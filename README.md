## üìå Project Overview
This dashboard explores HIV-related mortality and treatment access across countries and WHO regions from 2000 to 2018. Built with Tableau, it visualizes disparities in healthcare coverage, highlights the treatment gap for women and children, and spotlights regions in urgent need of intervention.

## üìä Key Metrics
- **Total deaths by year and WHO region**
- **People living with HIV by country**
- **ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) access** for:
  - Women
  - Children
  - General population
- **Regional gaps** in treatment needs vs. access

## üó∫Ô∏è Highlights from the Dashboard
- Sub-Saharan Africa bears the largest HIV burden but remains under-resourced for ART distribution.
- Many countries show a significant gap between **people needing** and **people receiving** ART ‚Äî especially among **women and children**.
- Despite global progress, **inequities remain stark** across regions like Southeast Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, and parts of Africa.

## üß≠ Featured Story Points
- **A Decade of Losses:** A timeline of HIV-related deaths globally  
- **Unequal Burden, Unequal Access:** Regional disparities in treatment  
- **Women & Children: The Forgotten Front:** Visualizing under-coverage  
- **Meeting the Need:** Progress on ART delivery by country  
- **A Call to Action:** A look ahead at remaining treatment gaps
